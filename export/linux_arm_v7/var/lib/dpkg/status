Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

Description: Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol library
 OPeNDAP provides software that allows you to access data over the internet,
 from programs that weren't originally designed for that purpose, as well
 as some that were. While OPeNDAP is the original developer of the Data Access
 protocol which its software uses, many other groups have adopted DAP
 and provide compatible clients, servers and software development kits.
 .
 With OPeNDAP software, you access data using a URL, just like a URL you
 would use to access a web page. However, before you request any data,
 you need to know how to request it in a form your browser can handle.
 OPeNDAP data is stored in binary form, and by default, it is
 transmitted that way, too.

  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 .
 JPEG-LS (ISO-14495-1/ITU-T.87) is a standard derived from the Hewlett Packard
 LOCO algorithm. JPEG LS has low complexity (meaning fast compression) and high
 compression ratios, similar to JPEG 2000. JPEG-LS is more similar to the old
 Lossless JPEG than to JPEG 2000, but interestingly the two different techniques
 result in vastly different performance characteristics.

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

 calling application for all supported formats. The related OGR
 library (which lives within the GDAL source tree) provides
 a similar capability for simple features vector data.
 .
 GDAL supports many popular data formats, including commonly used
 ones (GeoTIFF, JPEG, PNG and more) as well as the ones used in
 GIS and remote sensing software packages (ERDAS Imagine,
 ESRI Arc/Info, ENVI, PCI Geomatics). Also supported many remote
 sensing and scientific data distribution formats such as HDF,
 EOS FAST, NOAA L1B, NetCDF, FITS.
 .
 OGR library supports popular vector formats like ESRI Shapefile,
 TIGER data, S57, MapInfo File, DGN, GML and more.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: HTTP library implementation in C -- Shared library
 It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
 implementation called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been
 split into separate packages.

 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support

Description: Video Acceleration (VA) API for Linux -- runtime
 Video Acceleration API (VA API) is a library ("libVA") and API specification
 which enables and provides access to graphics hardware (GPU) acceleration for
 video processing on Linux and UNIX based operating systems. Accelerated
 processing includes video decoding, video encoding, subpicture blending and
 rendering. The specification was originally designed by Intel for its GMA
 (Graphics Media Accelerator) series of GPU hardware, the API is however not
 limited to GPUs or Intel specific hardware, as other hardware and manufacturers
 can also freely use this API for hardware accelerated video decoding.
 .
 This package provides the main libva library.

Description: HTTP library implementation in C -- GNOME support library
 It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
 implementation called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been
 split into separate packages.
 .
 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 The GNOME support library is used for features which are important to
 GNOME apps, but which require GNOME-specific libraries that non-GNOME
 apps may not want to add dependencies on.
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support
 .

      10-bit image file formats.
    * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.
    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the
      included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on
      images with film grain.
    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily
      be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR
      software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,
      integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
      affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
      applications.

Description: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .

Description: Direct solution of large, sparse systems of linear equations
 SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of
 large, sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations on high
 performance machines.
 .
 The library is written in C and is callable from either C or Fortran.
 The library routines will perform an LU decomposition with partial
 pivoting and triangular system solves through forward and back
 substitution. The LU factorization routines can handle non-square
 matrices but the triangular solves are performed only for square
 matrices. The matrix columns may be preordered (before factorization)
 either through library or user supplied routines. This preordering
 for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization. Working
 precision iterative refinement subroutines are provided for improved
 backward stability. Routines are also provided to equilibrate the
 system, estimate the condition number, calculate the relative
 backward error, and estimate error bounds for the refined solutions.
 .
 This package contains the SuperLU shared library.

Description: MIT Kerberos runtime libraries - Support library
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) parsing and manipulation toolkit
 Services provided by Libcroco
  * A parser module that provides
    o A SAC like API. SAC stands for Simple API for CSS. SAC is an event driven
      API which resembles SAX in the xml world.
    o A CSSOM like API. CSSOM stands for Cascading Style Sheet Object Model.
 .
    The libcroco parser implements the CSS Level 2 specification, the CSS
    forward compatibility rules and the CSS cascading rules.
 .
  * A CSS2 selection engine
    Given an xml element node (that obviously comes from an xml document) and
    a stylesheet cascade, the Libcroco selection engine can evaluate the css
    selectors of the cascade and return the style properties associated to
    the xml element node.
 .
    Note that the xml manipulation toolkit used by the libcroco selection
    engine at the moment is libxml2.

Description: Layout and rendering of internationalized text
 Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
 on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
 needed. however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the GTK+
 widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
 font handling for GTK+-2.0.
 .
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with
 four different font backends:
  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

Description: FFmpeg library for image scaling and various conversions - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized image scaling and colorspace and pixel
 format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling
    options and algorithms are available. This is usually a lossy process.
  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and
    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.
    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout
    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),
    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the
    source and destination colorspaces differ.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - common files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,
     graphics, 4096 colors, with built-in page cache including search
     functions;
   * Closed Caption decoder which supports roll-up, pop-up and paint-on style
     caption, color, expanded character set, text attributes and free text
     placement;
   * Renders Teletext and Caption pages, can export to HTML, PNG and other
     formats.
   * Can determine network names;
   * Can find Teletext subtitle and program pages;
   * Functions to extract data transmissions in Teletext streams (currently
     Page Format Clear and Independent Data Line Format A);
   * Can multiplex and demultiplex DVB VBI PES and TS streams.
 .
 This package contains internationalization files.

 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 eigenvalues with user specified features such as those of largest
 real part or largest magnitude. Storage requirements are on the order
 of n*k locations. No auxiliary storage is required. A set of Schur
 basis vectors for the desired k-dimensional eigen-space is computed
 which is numerically orthogonal to working precision. Numerically
 accurate eigenvectors are available on request.
 .

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - runtime files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,
     graphics, 4096 colors, with built-in page cache including search
     functions;
   * Closed Caption decoder which supports roll-up, pop-up and paint-on style
     caption, color, expanded character set, text attributes and free text
     placement;
   * Renders Teletext and Caption pages, can export to HTML, PNG and other
     formats.
   * Can determine network names;
   * Can find Teletext subtitle and program pages;
   * Functions to extract data transmissions in Teletext streams (currently
     Page Format Clear and Independent Data Line Format A);
   * Can multiplex and demultiplex DVB VBI PES and TS streams.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (library)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Description: validating XML parser library for C++
 Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of
 C++.  Xerces-C++ makes it easy to give your application the ability
 to read and write XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing,
 generating, manipulating, and validating XML documents. Xerces-C++ is
 faithful to the XML 1.0 recommendation and associated standards (DOM
 1.0, DOM 2.0, SAX 1.0, SAX 2.0, Namespaces, XML Schema Part 1 and
 Part 2).  It also provides experimental implementations of XML 1.1
 and DOM Level 3.0.  The parser provides high performance, modularity,
 and scalability.

Description: generic font configuration library - support binaries
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.

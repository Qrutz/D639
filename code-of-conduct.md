## Code of Conduct

### How do we plan to collaborate?

Weekly meetings - Amount of meetings depends on workload and can be flexible. Communication through discord, and if we have any questions we can ask each other. We will encourage open and transparent communication.

### How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

Issue boards and Milestones on Git. Keeping good communication through Scrum meetings and Discord. Issues are signed on Git to a person responsible.

### How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

Knowledge is transferred through our knowledge-transfer channel on Discord. Every team member is required to share all useful information on the channel, preferably before the Scrum meetings. As mentioned previously, we will encourage open and transparent communication. By doing this, other team-members might pick up knowledge in that way.

### What is our usual communication plan?

Dynamic communication plan depending on the workflow and workload. Communication happens through Discord and Scrum meetings. Extra meetings can be issued if necessary. We will be active listeners to make sure that everyone's perspectives are heard and understood.

### How will we solve conflicts?

Open communication and constructive feedback is important. To avoid conflicts when it comes to changes done to the system, we will keep each other updated by posting in the communications-channel whenever any larger update is done. We will have disagreements when it comes to certain stuff, but we have to disagree respectfully and do it in a constructive way. In case of disagreements that do not work out, we will take a vote.
If any team-member is not be able to handle their workload themselves, we want that person to communicate this as soon as possible so that we can help each other without having to stress because of deadlines closing in. We will also make it clear between each other about what time everyone usually work/study, and when it's okay to write to them about things related to the course. Some people prefer to work early, and some late.

### How do you plan to ensure responsible use of LLMs in your project and how do you transparently and traceably document the use of LLMs?

Using LLM's such as chatGPT, llama and gemini is allowed, as long as we are honest and open with how we use it. For example if it's used to generate text, re-write text, brainstorm new ideas, or if it's used to produce code. We have a no copy-paste policy that everyone agrees to follow. This also applies to code. When we generate code, we want the person that generates it to truly know what the code does. Writing the code yourself, and "following along" when writing every line of code is a lot better than just copy-pasting. By doing this, we can tweak the code and make it more readable or efficient. 

For traceability, we will use footnotes to document the part of the text where we have used an LLM for helping out or generating documentation. If a person has used an LLM for an answer, we want them to be honest and open with it. A second person can take a look at the material that the LLM has produced and fact-check it and make sure the code is correct and robust. If we commit code generated with LLM, we will add the information to the commit message. For example < -m "Add fix to feature" -m "Parts of code generated with LLM" >

## Code of Conduct

### How do we plan to collaborate?

Weekly meetings - Amount of meetings depends on workload and can be flexible. Communication through discord, and if we have any questions we can ask each other. We will encourage open and transparent communication.

### How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

Issue boards and Milestones on Git. Keeping good communication through Scrum meetings and Discord. Issues are signed on Git to a person responsible.

### How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

Knowledge is transferred through our knowledge-transfer channel on Discord. Every team member is required to share all useful information on the channel, preferably before the Scrum meetings. As mentioned previously, we will encourage open and transparent communication. By doing this, other team-members might pick up knowledge in that way.

### What is our usual communication plan?

Dynamic communication plan depending on the workflow and workload. Communication happens through Discord and Scrum meetings. Extra meetings can be issued if necessary. We will be active listeners to make sure that everyone's perspectives are heard and understood.

### How will we solve conflicts?

Open communication and constructive feedback is important. We will have disagreements when it comes to certain stuff, but we have to disagree respectfully and do it in a constructive way. In case of disagreements that do not work out, we will take a vote.

### How do you plan to ensure responsible use of LLMs in your project and how do you transparently and traceably document the use of LLMs?

We have a no copy-paste policy that everyone agrees to follow. We use footnotes to document that weâ€™ve used LLMs in the project. If a person has used an LLM for an answer, be honest and open with it. A second person can take a look at the material that the LLM has produced and fact-check it.
